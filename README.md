## Description

I was tasked to make the code of a website as clean and clear as possible. The purpose of this was to have other coders to be able to easily understand the code. This was done by changing some of the code to more practical code. For example, changing Div to Section, adding alt text to images, and lastly adding comments. Overall, I learned even if the code works properly there's always an opportunity to make it better.

## Installation

I copied the challenge code from the GitHub repository, and after that, I started to work on my git bash to put it in my repository. Finally, I fixed the code and updated that code to my repository.
## Usage

Ultimately the usage was for coders to have an easier time reading the code and to make the code look cleaner.
